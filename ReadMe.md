## Project Structure:

**PostgreSQL** , **MongoDB** and **CSV** - these 2 databases and 1 csv file are used in this project.

## Plan:

- We make some routes and controllers for executing SQL/NoSQL query with the database.
- Requests and responses are stored in the CSV file.
- Then we connect a HTML page with the node project then send malicious code from the form of the HTML page.

Your server should be available at **localhost:5000** .... :)
